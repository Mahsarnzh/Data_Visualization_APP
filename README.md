# Data_Visualization_APP

Make sure you have R installed on your system. If not, you can download and install it from the official R website (https://www.r-project.org/).

Ensure that the necessary packages and dependencies are installed. You can do this by running the following command in the R console:

`install.packages(c("shiny", "dplyr", "ggplot2"))`

This will install the required packages for running the app (shiny, dplyr, ggplot2). Adjust the package list as needed if there are additional dependencies.

Open the data_explorer_app.Rproj file in RStudio or your preferred R IDE. This will set the working directory and project settings appropriately.

Open the `global.R`, `server.R`, and `ui.R` files. These files contain the necessary code for the app's functionality.

In the RStudio IDE, navigate to the `global.R` file and click the "Run" button to execute the code in the file. This will load the required functions and set up any global variables.

Next, navigate to the server.R file and run it in a similar way as step 5. This will start the server that handles the app's logic and interactions.

Finally, open the `ui.R` file and run it as in the previous steps. This will launch the user interface (UI) of the app.

Once the server and UI are running, you should see a web browser window or tab open automatically, displaying the app's interface.

Follow the on-screen instructions within the app to explore the provided data or perform any desired analysis.


Please note that this description assumes you are using RStudio as your IDE. If you are using a different IDE or running R from the command line, adjust the steps accordingly.
